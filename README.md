Hello, I am Johanna, unfortunatley I¬¥m not the person who talks flashy about herself.

There is one thing I can admit, I am a Yoga Teacher. The only coding language, I know so far, is Sanskrit üòâ

Here are some of my favourite Poses:


* üêÆ Gomukhasana 
   
* üò¥ Shavasana 
   
* üêï Adho Mukha Svanasana 
       
  
  [In this picture](https://www.instagram.com/p/DKB2MJdPsq8/?img_index=1&igsh=MWRhdmJ5aDExbXpqdw==)
you can see me, in a heart opening pose which is called "fish-pose".



üíö **reach out to me**, if you feel stressed or if you feel any tension in your body üì≤ call me! ‚≠ê we will find a solution üíö 

:pray: Namaste

   Below you can see my favourite Yoga Class, I made for my final exam.
