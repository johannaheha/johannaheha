# About me

Hello, I am Johanna, unfortunatley IÂ´m not the person who talks flashy about herself.
There is one thing I can admit, I am a Yoga Teacher. The only coding language, I know so far, is Sanskrit ðŸ˜‰

Here are some of my favourite Poses:
- Gomukhasana
- Shavasana
- Adho Mukha Svanasana

you can see me, in a heart opening pose which is called "fish-pose".
