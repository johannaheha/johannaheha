# Hey there, I’m Johanna — aka *Julia Labyrinth* 

### 💻 Full-Stack Web Developer in Progress | Yoga Teacher by Heart  

I’m currently part of the **[neue fische](https://www.neuefische.de/)** 12-month **Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp**,  
learning how to build modern, scalable, and creative web applications — from frontend to backend.  

When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me in a handstand or meditating on how to fix that one elusive bug 🧘‍♀️

🧘‍♀️ From Sanskrit to Syntax

Before I started learning to code, I taught Yoga —
so yes, I used to speak Sanskrit before I spoke JavaScript.

Some of my favorite poses:

🐮 Gomukhasana – Cow Face Pose

😴 Shavasana – Corpse Pose (a.k.a. Dev Mode Recovery)

🐕 Adho Mukha Svanasana – Downward-Facing Dog

💚 Let’s Connect

Feeling stressed about a bug? Need help finding your inner peace — or that missing semicolon?
📩 Reach out — I’m always happy to help bring balance to both body and browser.


“Yoga teaches us to cure what need not be endured,
and endure what cannot be cured — just like debugging.”
— B.K.S. Iyengar
